## ðŸ”¨ Usage

The best way to see `react-native-uix` in-action, is to take a look at the [example](https://github.com/Kieran-McIntyre/react-native-uix/tree/master/example)!

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider, useStyle, LayoutTopLevelScreen, GroupedTable } from "react-native-uix";

function HomeScreen() {
    const { themeSet } = useStyle();

    const tableItems = [
        {
            id: 0,
            label: "Hotels",
            count: 2,
            iconBackgroundColor: themeSet.red,
            icon: faBuilding,
            onPress: () => {},
        },
        {
            id: 1,
            label: "Restaraunts",
            count: 2,
            iconBackgroundColor: themeSet.teal,
            icon: faUtensils,
            onPress: () => {},
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            label: "Universities",
            count: 3,
            iconBackgroundColor: themeSet.yellow,
            icon: faUniversity,
            onPress: () => {},
        },
    ];

    return (
        <LayoutTopLevelScreen title="Home" navigation={navigation}>
            <GroupedTable title="Places" items={tableItems} />
        </LayoutTopLevelScreen>
    );
}

function App() {
    const HomeStack = createStackNavigator();

    return (
        <ThemeProvider>
            <HomeStack.Navigator>
                <HomeStack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
            </HomeStack.Navigator>
        </ThemeProvider>
    );
}

```

## ðŸŽ¨ Custom Styling

Customising the theme of your app can be achieved using the `ThemeProvider` component. You can determine the colours for both light and dark mode.

| Light | Dark |
| --- | --- |
| ![light theme](https://i.ibb.co/F85y3Sm/home-light.png) | ![dark theme](https://i.ibb.co/VWk9hSz/home-dark.png) 

### _ThemeProvider_ component

#### Usage

```javascript
import { ThemeProvide } from "react-native-uix";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const theme = {
    light: {
      textPrimary: "#345000",
      tint: "#2188ff",
      systemBackground: "#ff0000"
    },
    dark: {
      textPrimary: "#345088",
      tint: "#388bfd",
      systemBackground: "#ff0055"
    },
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <AppNavigation />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};

```

You can customise any of the colors below for your theme. If a color is not provided, the corresponding color in the `DEFAULT_THEME` is used.

```javascript
tint,
textPrimary,
textSecondary
textTertiary,
textQuarternary,
systemBackground,
secondarySystemBackground,
tertiarySystemBackground,
separator,
blue,
green,
indigo,
orange,
pink,
purple,
red,
teal,
yellow,
white,
```

### _useStyle_ hook

If you are making your own custom components and would like to make use of your custom theme, whilst supporting dark mode, this is where the `useStyle` hook becomes useful.

#### Usage

```javascript
import { useStyle } from "react-native-uix";

const MyComponent = () => {
    const dynamicStyles = (theme) => {
        return {
            container: {
                width: 20,
                height: 20,
                backgroundColor: theme.systemBackground,
            }
        }
    }

    const { styles } = useStyle(dynamicStyles);
  
    return (
      <View style={styles.container} />
    );
  };
}
```
